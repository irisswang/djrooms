## Project Title
Playlist Live

## Overview
We plan to create an interactive music web application that contains multiple themed rooms with one person DJ’ing each room. Users who enter a room can listen to the music that is being controlled by the respective DJ. The DJ will be live streaming their playlist, where any changes to the player will also be projected on the listener’s browser. 

## Key Features
* DJ rooms where users can join rooms and listen to currently playing songs that the DJ controls
* People can add live comments in each of the hosted rooms (real time chat feature)
* Log in functionality for individual soundcloud users
* Listeners can queue songs that will be reviewed by the DJ to play
* Listeners can link songs in the comments
* Follow DJ’s
